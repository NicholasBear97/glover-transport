# Glover Transport 1.0

## Introduction
Glover Transport is a webpage built for a local courier business seen at https://www.glovertransport.com.

This was a volunteer project made with only HTML and CSS to meet basic business requirements.

## Future Release
As I continue to grow as a developer, I often have a growing desire to redo Glover Transport. Luckily, I recently contacted the owner of the business who would also like to see a revamp.

I will continue to update this README with future plans for Glover Transport 2.0.
